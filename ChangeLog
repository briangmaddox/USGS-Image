ChangeLog for version 9.0 of the Image libraries.

Changes from version 8.3 (and 8.9 and 8.99 and 8.999 etc)

   Removed GreyPalletteImage and RGBPalletteImage.  Nobody
   used them, and they sucked.  (Well, the Trans lib uses
   them, but that will change soon.)  A lot of stuff has
   been purified.  Also, the directory structure has changed,
   and the clients of this library have been moved out of
   the structure.
   
Changes from version 8.2

   Added the Octree class, for color quantization, and fixed
   (gasp!) some bugs in the RGB and Grey Image?File classes.
   It seemed the Rectangle methods weren't working quite right.
   Did some other stuff, but I can't remember what it was.
   Don't use CorePalletteImageData class.  It is incomplete.
   This lib uses the latest versions of the TIFF and GeoTIFF
   libraries (Beta 18 and Beta 06 respectively).  This lib
   does version 0.2 of the GeoTIFF spec.

Changes from version 8.1

   Removed ABORTERRMSG, EXITERRMSG, and ERRMSG from ImageCommon.h
   They were obsolete, and were replaced by the ImageDebug class.
   
Changes from version 8.0

   Added classes:  CoreImageData
   Changed interface in TIFFImage?File, get/setTag() now
   returns bool (true for success).
   Added IMAGE_GTIF to ImageCommon.h
   Added GeoTIFF to Image::getFileType() (only in input objects)

Changes from version 7.1

   Added classes:  GeoTIFFImageIFile and GeoTIFFImageOFile
                   DOQImageIFile

Changes from version 7.0

   Added support for 4-bit pixels in TIFFImageIFile.

Changes from version 6.999
   
   Cleaned up the source a lot.  Added -=lots=-
   of debugging messages, which can be turned on 
   from the ImageDebug object.  An instance of
   ImageDebug is included in the libraries, and
   can be accessed by including ImageDebug.h.
   This instance is called gDebug.
 
Changes from version 6.99

   Small bug in TIFFImageIFile was fixed.

Changes from version 6.4 - 6.9

   There were no versions 6.4 - 6.9.

Changes from version 6.3

   Added spinners to some of the utilities.  Added Debug object
   to library.  Debugging messages should be easy to turn on and
   off.  Added untiled format support to CRLImageIFile.
   
Changed from version 6.2

   TIFFImage?File can now set and get all the TIFFTAGs.
   Various small bugs were exterminates.  Tried to get
   rid of all compiler warnings.

Changed from version 6.1

   There was no version 6.1.

Changes from version 6.0

   Image and ImageData now have means for obtaining status
   information, similar to that included in the iostreams
   classes.

Changes from version 5.2

   Raster.cc and Raster.h are included in the Image library.

   TIFFImageIFile and DGPImageIFile have scanline caches now.

   
Changes from version 5.1

   All includes are now of the form
      
      #include "Image/Whatever.h"

   Instead of
      
      #include "Whatever.h".

   DOQImageIFile has been deleted from this library and moved
   to the SDTS libraries.

Changes from version 5.0

   Image and all of it's children now have two new methods,
   getRawRGBPixel() and getRawRGBScanline().  These work
   the same as in the ImageData classes.  

   Also, RGBImage, GreyImage, RGBPalletteImage and 
   GreyPalletteImage now have constructors which take a filename
   as an argument, and determine the proper ImageData object
   for the Image.  Constructors which take only a filename 
   create read-only objects.  Constructors which take a filename
   and width and height create write-only objects.

   getFileType() was added to Image.  This determines the type
   of file (TIFF, RGB, etc...) from a combination of filename
   extension and magic number.  If the file exists, and a magic
   number is found in the file, the magic number is the sole
   determinant of file type, unless the extension is .rgb,
   .grey, or .doq, in which case the extension is the 
   determinant of file type.  If the "create" constructor (the
   one where you have to specify a width and height), the file
   type is specified by file extension.

Changes from version 4.1:

   ImageData and all of it's children now have two new methods,
   getRawRGBPixel and getRawRGBScanline, which use the new struct
   RawRGBPixel, defined in ImageCommon.h.  These were added because
   of performance considerations.

Changes from version 4.0:

   The class 'Pixel' has changed to 'AbstractPixel' in order to
   avoid name collisions with X11 stuff.

Changes from versions prior to 4.0:

   Way to much to mention, but a lot of bugs were eliminated.
