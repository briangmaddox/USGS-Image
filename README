This is the distribution of the C++ Image library, version 9.0.
This file is hopelessly out of date.  Look for a new version of
it in the next major release.  See the ChangeLog for changes 
from the last version.

To build the library, type 'configure' and then 'make'.  This
should build the library and install the includes and library
in the appropriate places.  If you want to get fancy, RTFM on
autoconf and configure.  :)
